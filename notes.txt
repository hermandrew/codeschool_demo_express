- Moving the execution of the server into a bin dir is weird, but I guess I kind of get it.  One thing it does is exports the app as a a modue which makes it usable for testing.  Beyond that, I'm not exactly sure why you would do this, other than making it feel more like a server (executing from CL, instead of through node).

- npm install <package> --save-dev is very interesting.  It seems like a really good way to manage environments.  Dunno how exactly this will play out.

- npm shrinkwrap is cool.  Basically creates a lockfile so that versions of dependencies don't get fucked.  Neato.

- Tests are run somehow from the package.json file.  I'm not sure yet how a bunch would work.  Also, mocha is 3rd party, so if I wanna' get good at that bullshit, I'll have to look that up.But yeah, so you then you run `npm test` and it'll run whatever test scripts are in there.
